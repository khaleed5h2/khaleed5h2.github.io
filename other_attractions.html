				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hussain Sagar is a heart-shaped lake in Hyderabad, Telangana, built by Ibrahim Quli Qutb Shah in 1563. It is spread across an area of 5.7 square kilometers and is fed by the River Musi. A large monolithic statue of the Gautama Buddha, erected in 1992, stands on Gibraltar Rock in the middle of the lake. <br><br>

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hussain Sagar was built across a tributary of the river Musi river in 1563 by Ibrahim Quli Qutb Shah. The lake was named after Hussain Shah Wali, who helped to design it. It is an artificial lake that holds water perennially fed by canals from Musi river. Hussain Sagar was the main source of water supply to Hyderabad before Himayat Sagar and Osman Sagar were built on river Musi.<br><br>

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Buddha statue was chiseled out of a white granite rock, weighing 450 tons. It was carved by 200 sculptors for two years. The statue was transported to Hyderabad in November 1988. After initial problems, the statue was erected on 12 April 1992 on a red lotus pedestal.<br><br>

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the main attractions of the Lumbini Park is the giant clock at the entrance of the park which has been designed using various kinds of colourful flowering plants. Along with seasonal flowering plants, wide variety of cacti and rocks, the park also has many options to keep kids entertained. The Musical fountain and water cascades attract everyone. The sight of water shooting up to the sky, making a screen of water where the history of Hyderabad is being shown is something not many of us have seen before. It is an experience in itself. The best part of laser show is that just 3D. You will see a city created in 3D right at a park.<br><br>

Until about 1940, people would visit his tomb on the anniversary of his death, taking incense and other offerings to him. The Nizams would send to his tomb on 25 March every year, a box of cheroots and a bottle of beer. His grave had become like a shrine. He is also remembered in Hyderabad, with the area called Mussa Ram Bagh (Monsieur Raymond). This Obelisk also offers a beautiful view of the Old city of Hyderabad.<br><br>

		<h2>Paigah Tombs</h2>
		<div>
			<p class="col-lg-8">

Built of white marble, Paigah tombs captivate visitors with intricately designed interiors.<br><br>

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These tombs have been skilfully carved and their inlaid mosaic tile work is breathtaking. The famous ‘Jali’ work makes it even more attractive. Each Tomb has been designed differently, ensuing a unique style and design. Each Paigah tomb is consisted of elaborate covering and marble fences which are adorned with exemplary geometrical and floral designs. However, if you observe carefully, you will be able to notice the designing difference between the tombs. The semi circular arches, representing Indian architecture, are also seen here.<br><br>

		<h2>British Residency Building</h2>
		<div>
			<p class="col-lg-8">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The building was at once the embassy of the East India Company to the court of the Nizam of Hyderabad, and the residence of James Kirkpatrick, the British Resident, as well as his successors. Within its compound there were several quarters, including a zenana (women's quarters) where Khair un Nissa lived. Within the compound is a miniature model of the building- legend has it that this was so Kirkpatrick's wife, who remained in purdah, could see the entire mansion, including the front. This scaled model has recently been beautifully restored.<br><br>

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the Indian Rebellion of 1857, a group of rebels, led by Maulvi Allauddin and Turrebaz Khan, attacked the residency. After the events of 1857, the British erected martello towers at the residency, which were demolished in 1954.<br><br>

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After independence in 1947, the building became vacant. In 1949 it was converted into a women's college, Osmania University College for Women.<br><br>

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a court directive to the Archaeological Survey of India, it is now a protected monument. However, the building has suffered much damage and part of the ceiling has collapsed.<br><br>
