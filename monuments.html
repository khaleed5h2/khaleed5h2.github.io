		<h2>Charminar</h2>
		<div>
			<p class="col-lg-8">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charminar Hyderabad is among the top 10 historical places in India, and it is one of those marvels that is soaked knee-deep in history. Its literal translation is "char" (four) and "minar" (minarets/towers). It is a classic example of Catia style of Islamic architecture. It is built with a wide variety of stones like marble, granite, mortar and limestone. The grandiosity of this structure will leave you awestruck!<br><br>

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charminar was built in 1591 during the rule of the Qutb Shahi dynasty, by its fifth ruler- Sultan Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah. A lot of theories have been put forth about Charminar and the reasons for its construction. The mainstream and the most accepted one is that a plague epidemic had hit the city of Hyderabad, and the ruler Sultan Muhammad Quli Qutb prayed at a particular spot for the plague to end. And when it did end, at that very place where he offered his prayers, the grand Charminar was built.<br><br>

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various folklores and stories have been circulating about Charminar since time immemorial. One of them is that it was built at the exact location where Quli Qutb Shah saw his future queen Bhagmati for the first time! Another one talks about Charminar having an underground tunnel connected to the Golconda fort. However, due to lack of evidence, many such stories about Charminar history have been rejected by scholars and historians alike.<br><br>

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beauty of Charminar Hyderabad does not simply lie in its structure, but also in what the structure means to the people and its symbolic importance. The area surrounding Charminar is bustling with energy at all times. There are innumerable shops selling innumerable things! But that is what Charminar Hyderabad represents; it is beautiful and larger-than-life, yet grounded amidst the everyday-life. It is sacred and mundane at the same time.<br><br>

		<h2>Golconda Fort</h2>
		<div>
			<p class="col-lg-8">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golconda Fort is located in the western part of Hyderabad city and is about 9 km from the Hussain Sagar Lake. The outer fort occupies an area of three square kilometers, which is 4.8 kilometers in length.<br><br>

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was originally known as Mankal, and built on a hilltop in the year 1143. It was originally a mud fort under the reign of Rajah of Warangal. Later it was fortified between 14th and 17th centuries by the Bahmani Sultans and then the ruling Qutub Shahi dynasty. Golconda was the principal capital of the Qutub Shahi kings. The inner fort contains ruins of palaces, mosques and a hill top pavilion, which rises about 130 meters high and gives a bird’s eye view of other buildings.<br><br>

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golconda fort is undoubtedly one of most magnificent fortress complexes in India. The history of Golconda Fort goes back to early 13th century, when it was ruled by the Kakatiya’s followed by Qutub Shahi kings, who ruled the region in 16th and 17th century. The fortress rests on a granite hill 120 meters high while huge crenellated ramparts surround this structure.<br><br>

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was initially called Shepherd’s Hill, meaning Golla Konda in Telugu while according to legend, on this rocky hill a shepherd boy had come across an idol and the information was conveyed to the ruling Kakatiya king at that time. The king constructed a mud fort around this holy spot and after 200 years, Bahamani rulers took possession of the place. Later the Qutub Shahi kings converted this into massive granite fort extending 5km in circumference. The fort is considered a mute witness to historic events. The Qutub Shahis reign at Golconda ended in 1687 when it was run over by Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, who intentionally left it in ruins<br><br>

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golconda still boasts of mounted cannons, four drawbridges, eight gateways, and majestic halls, magazines, stables etc. The outermost enclosure is called Fateh Darwaza meaning Victory gate, after Aurangzeb’s army marched successfully through this gate. At Fateh Darwaza one can witness fantastic acoustical effects, which is one among the many famous engineering marvels at Golconda.<br><br>

		<h2>Chowmahalla Palace</h2>
		<div>
			<p class="col-lg-8">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grandeur of rulers, glory of its past, glimpse of their enigmatic way of living, are still alive in the form of palaces like Chowmahalla Palace, a place worth visiting.<br><br>

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Built in the 18th century, almost 200 years ago, the Chowmahalla Palace is one of the popular sightseeing places in Hyderabad. The literal meaning of this place is “Four Palaces” with “Chow” means four in Urdu and “Mahalat” which is the plural of “Mahalel” meaning palaces. Chowmahalla palace is said to resemble Shah Palace of Tehran in Iran.<br><br>

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The construction of Chowmahalla Palace was mainly completed between 1857 to 1869 during the rule of fifth Nizam, Afzar-ud-Daulah, Asaf Jav V. However, its building is mostly credited to Nizam Salabat Jang in 1790. The Palace originally covered 45 acres which extended from the Laad Bazaar on the north to the Aspan Chowk Road on the south. Now, the total remained area of the palace is close to 12 acres.<br><br>

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chowmahalla Palace is consisted of two courtyards which are divided into the northern courtyard and the southern courtyard. The southern courtyard of the palace has four palaces which are namely Afzal Mahal, Tahniyat Mahal, Mahtab Mahal, and Aftab Mahal. The Aftab Mahal is a two storied building and is the biggest of all the four. The northern courtyard which has been open to public, houses Bara Imam, a long corridor with many rooms on the eastern side, which was once the administrative wing. Another captivating feature of this courtyard is the Shishe-Alat. This was used to receive guests and public figures.<br><br>

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that Chowmahalla Palace used to have around 7000 attendants on any given day. For its grandeur and charm, it has been often compared to the Enchanted Gardens of the Arabian Nights for its grandeur.<br><br>

		<h2>Qutub Shahi Tombs</h2>
		<div>
			<p class="col-lg-8">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Qutub Shahi Tombs were planned and built by numerous monarchs who ruled the city and the state during the 18th century. Lying two kilometers from the Golconda Fort, the Qutub Shahi Tombs are built to Persian, Hindu and Pathani styles of architecture. Located in the heart of Hyderabad, these tombs are a famous landmark in the city. Domed structures, terraced gardens, intricate parapets and exquisite ornamentation can all be found at one place. What's more, the Deccan Festival is held at the Qutub Shahi Tombs every year, presenting an opportunity for all those who want to witness the architectural and engineering marvels of the 18th century. Small and big sarcophagi can be found here, although only a few of them remain and are open to public now. These monuments are not only known for its splendid artistry and sprawling gardens, but is also known for the countless tombs of the last standing royals of Golconda.<br><br>

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most important tombs at the Qutub Shahi Tombs is the one that belongs to the Qutub Shahi dynasty founder, Sultan Quli Qutub-ul-Mulk. He built his tomb himself and was the longest overseer of the architectural project. He also decided to build tombs that belonged to the non-ruling members of the royal families for example the sisters, nephews and nieces. The Qutub Shahi Tombs were built and dedicated to the seven Qutub Shahi rulers and their families who ruled Golconda for nearly 170 years.<br><br>

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grandeur of the tombs is shielded by the majestic, landscaped gardens of Ibrahim Bagh. The styles of the tombs are perhaps, the most important reason why thousands of tourists flock the resting places of these Golconda rulers. One will be able to see Hindu, Persian, Pathan and Deccan styles of architecture. As a result, you will be able to spot the amalgam of the Indo-Saracenic entrances, Persian minarets, domed structures and intricately designed columns. Inside, the tombs differ in size and number. One of the most modest looking tombs belongs to the founder of the Qutub Shahi dynasty himself-Sultan Quli Qutub-ul-Mulk.<br><br>

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simple designs and geometrical symmetry are probably the only patterns that glaze his sarcophagus. However, one of the most impressive tombs belongs to the founder of Hyderabad, Mohammed Quli Qutub Shah and rises to a height of 42 meters and protected by a large dome. Minarets and ornamental parapets complete the Islamic architecture and his tomb. The other tombs are still awe-inspiring in their own right.<br><br>
